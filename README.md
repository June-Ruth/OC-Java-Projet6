Pay My Buddy allows user to simply transfer money to other friends through the application.

## Information
* Author : No√©mie BARRAL - DA Java Student - OpenClassrooms
* Release date : 30 mars 2021

### Running Application
* The application works on port 8080
* The application works with a MySQL database on port 3306
* Before running, add username and password access for database in application.properties
* Run script create_database.sql before the first use.
* For demo version, the SetUpDataLoader class create 1 user and 1 admin. Suppress the TODO part before production.

### Running Tests
* Before running, add username and password access for database in integration-test.properties
* Run script create_db_test.sql before running tests for the first time.
* Script create_default_value.sql is automatically managed by tests and will add default values for testing.

## Business Logic
In this application version, we consider that only one bank account is available per user.

The user can transfer money from its account to its bank but the feature to add money on its account is not already available.
